# PHRAMEWORK    
## A minimalist php framework inspired by Laravel!

This minimalist framework is intended to be a fun sideproject to increase my familiarity with PHP and OOP. My second goal in developing this is to provide a much simpler alternative to Laravel. It is not intended to have all the functionalities of Laravel but it's intended to create small web apps that can be run on a shared server, not on VPS. 
Composer will be required only during the development time to use the included PHPUnit for TDD. 

Documentation status: pending first release!
